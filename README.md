## ✦ What is Traces?

**Traces** is a quiet, ancient-inspired web experience.

Dates exist as marks on a surface —  
etched, worn, and discovered rather than explained.

There is:

◼ no timeline  
◼ no order  
◼ no beginning  
◼ no end  

Only traces of moments.

## ✦ The Idea

> Memory is not linear.  
> It does not announce itself.  
> It remains.

Traces treats memory as something **physical**.

Dates appear as if carved into an aged surface inspired by stone, parchment, erosion, and time.  
Meaning is never forced.  
It appears only when attention is given.

The interface disappears.  
The surface stays still.  
The user observes.

---

## ✦ Experience

Hover.
Pause.
Notice.
Move on.

• Dates are scattered organically  
• Some are clear  
• Some are worn  
• Some are almost lost  

Nothing guides you.  
Nothing explains itself.

It is a surface where moments were left behind.

Meaning is optional.
